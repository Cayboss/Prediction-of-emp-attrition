# Prediction of Employee Attrition

This project aims to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) using various machine learning models. By analyzing HR data, the model identifies key factors contributing to employee turnover, helping businesses improve employee retention strategies.

### Project Overview

Employee attrition, whether voluntary or involuntary, is a significant challenge for organizations, leading to a loss of talent, decreased productivity, and increased costs associated with hiring and training new employees. The departure of employees, whether due to factors like inadequate salary, poor work environment, or other personal reasons, can erode a companyâ€™s human capital, affecting its overall performance and culture.
By identifying key factors contributing to turnover, organizations can implement proactive strategies to reduce attrition, retain talent, and optimize operational costs.

### Business Questions

- What factors contribute most to employee attrition?
- How accurate can we predict which employees are at high risk of leaving?
- What type of measures should the company take in order to reduce employee attrition?

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists with the following features:

- Number of Records: 1,470
- Features: 35 attributes such as Age, Department, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, etc.
- Target Variable: Attrition (Binary: Yes/No)
